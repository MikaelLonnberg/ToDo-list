## About The App

ToDo-list is an app that you can write down activities that needs to be done. You can cross activities out when completed, and delete when not necessary anymore. The app will also keep track of the number of activities being completed.

## Technologies

I used the following technologies `html`, `css` and `JavaScript` for the whole project. `html`was used for the basic layout of the app. `css`was used to style the app. `JavaScript` was used for everything else. Making the table, adding rows and deleting them. Keeping track of ongoing activities and validating the user's input.

## Setup

- download all the files and open index.html in your browser
- download or clone the repository
- open index.html in browser
OR
- open the app straight from the link provided at the top.

- type in a new assignment in "Tehtävät"
- click "Lisää tehtävä"- button to add assignment
- mark an assignment as done by clicking ✔️-sign
- delete an assignment by pressing "Poista"-button
- the counter will show active and all assignments

## Status

ToDo-list is done for now. `Version 2` might me out at some point.
